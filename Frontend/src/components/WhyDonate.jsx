        {/* Description */}
        <p className="text-lg md:text-xl leading-relaxed text-gray-700 max-w-4xl mx-auto mb-6">
          Donating blood is one of the simplest and most powerful ways to make a 
          difference in someoneâ€™s life. Every few seconds, someone in the world 
          requires blood for survivalâ€”whether due to accidents, surgeries, 
          complications during childbirth, or illnesses like cancer and anemia.  
          By donating just one pint of blood, you can save up to 
          <span className="font-bold text-red-600"> three lives</span>.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg md:text-xl leading-relaxed text-gray-700 max-w-4xl mx-auto mb-12">
          Beyond saving lives, blood donation also contributes to community health 
          by ensuring that hospitals and blood banks are always prepared for emergencies. 
          Regular donors play a vital role in maintaining a safe and sufficient blood supply.  
          Blood cannot be manufacturedâ€”it can only come from generous donors like you.  
          By giving blood, youâ€™re not only helping patients but also becoming a part 
          of a compassionate and life-saving network.
